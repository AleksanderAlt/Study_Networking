## Vajalik tarkvara

To run a Linux virtual machine (VM) on top of the regular operating system I installed:
- VirtualBox: is open-source software for virtualizing the x86 computing architecture. It created a VM to run another OS.
- Vagrant: is a tool for building and managing VM environments in a single workflow.

If you log out of the Linux instance or close the terminal, the next time you want to use it you need to run:
- cd networking
- vagrant ssh
