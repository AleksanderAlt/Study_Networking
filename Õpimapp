# Vajalik tarkvara
To run a Linux virtual machine (VM) on top of the regular operating system I installed:
- VirtualBox: is open-source software for virtualizing the x86 computing architecture. It acts as a hypervisor, creating a VM 
in which the user can run another OS (operating system).
- Vagrant: is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow.
